# datafun-06-eda

This project focuses on developing a custom exploratory data analysis (EDA) workflow using GitHub, Jupyter, pandas, Seaborn, and other leading data analytics tools.

## Create and Manage Virtual Environment

1. Open project folder in VS Code.
2. Open a terminal in VS Code to sync the latest project contents: `git pull` 
3. Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv .venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
5. Install necessary packages: `python3 -m pip install <package_name>`
6. Set VS Code Python Interpreter to use the .venv environment.
7. Use Git to track and push changes:  
   `git add .`  
   `git commit -m "Your commit message"`  
   `git push -u origin main`

## Dataset Description

The Titanic dataset is a well-known collection of data often used in data analysis and machine learning. It provides information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, which tragically sank on its first voyage in April 1912. The dataset includes details like age, gender, class, ticket fare, and survival staus. Itâ€™s a useful resource for exploring patterns and factors that might have affected survival during this historic event.

## Create Jupyter Notebook
1. Open project folder in VS Code.
2. Create Jupyter Notebook file: 'joannafarris_eda.ipynb'

## Load Dataset into a Pandas Dataframe
1. In project folder save dataset as csv file:`titanic.csv`  
2. In Jupyter Notebook file:  
   * import pandas:`import pandas as pd`  
   * load file into pandas dataframe: `df = pd.read_csv("titanic.csv")`

## Perform and publish a custom EDA project 

Demonstrate skills with Jupyter, pandas, Seaborn and popular tools for data analytics. The notebook should tell a data story and visually present findings in a clear and engaging manner.
